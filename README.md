# Alien_game
My version of Alien Invasion. The game runs on the pygame library. 
The game only supports FHD resolution(1920x1080).
The game supports a high score system.
In settings.p–Ω there are optimal settings for the game that can be changed.

Control: move - w/a/s/d, shot - space, exit - esc

If the game does not start the first time, try again.
